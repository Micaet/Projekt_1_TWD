# Wasted? Like Life After Drugs
The poster aims to raise awareness about the tragic issue of drug-related deaths. It highlights who is most affected by drug use and explores the broader economic impact. The data presented in the project is primarily sourced from the United States, with a focus on government statistics. However, we believe that these insights may also be relevant and provide valuable conclusions for other countries, given the shared human experience.
